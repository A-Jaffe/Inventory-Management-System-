# Inventory Management System
## Project Description
This program is written in python and is designed for a ficticious shoe company to track 
their inventory. It's functions include reading and writing from a txt file and providing
the user with the options to: *search for a shoe by code, restock the shoe with the lowest stock, mark the shoe with the highest stock for sale, calculate the value per item of each shoe and view all shoes in stock.* It is the third Capstone project required in the Hyperion Development Software Engineer bootcamp.
